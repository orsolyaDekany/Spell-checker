# Basic Spell Checker

## The Challenge

**Brief: Make a spell checker for BASIC English**

### Background

British American Scientific International Commercial (BASIC) English is a constructed language. It has 850 English words, carefully chosen to make the language easy to learn but still powerful enough to communicate every day ideas and actions. The rules of usage are identical to full English, so the speaker communicates in perfectly good, but simple, English.

It is an interesting exercise to try to write out a complicated idea in simple English (e.g. https://xkcd.com/1133), and a spell checker that tells you when you are using BASIC English would be a useful tool.

### Objectives

The main objective is to make something that works in ~ 1 hour

# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Install npm first `npm install`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.
